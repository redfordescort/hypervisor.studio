# Introducing the Game AI Transparency Framework

The role of generative AI in video games is an increasingly hot button issue right now. Three major constituents all want different things:

* Game studios and their leaders are under constant pressure to find efficiency or innovation opportunities, and many are turning or being forced to incorporate generative AI into game development.
* Game developers, the humans who make the games, are often feeling threatened by AI and its potential for job displacement.
* Players view the use of generative AI with skpeticism, and aren't afraid to speak up when they see AI in use.

In addition to different motivations, all of the contituents involved here have different levels of familiarity and understanding of what "AI" actually means. It doesn't help that "AI" as a term has had decades of semantic drift, with the latest hype cycle casting the term with negativity.

I believe the solution to the problems that are brewing is clear transparency, and towards that end, I'm proposing the Game AI Transparency (GAIT) framework for consideration. Studios can chose to label their games with a GAIT level, which signals to players and developers how exactly AI was (or wasn't) used in it's production. 

See more [here](), but in short, the features of the framework include:

1. Clear definitions of AI usage types, with six AI use levels spanning from "absolutely no generative AI used in production" to "Live generative AI is used while you are playing the game"
2. Defined "red lines" that no studio that adopts GAIT is allowed to cross - unconsented creative replication, concealing AI use, mandatory AI safeguards for minors
3. Player-meaningful descriptions of how AI is used
4. Intentional and clear connection to existing regulatory requirements, including governmental and platform compliance
5. An explicit exemption for accessibility functionality, so as to not prevent acomodations for players with disabilities

With the exception of the red lines, the framework meant to be neutral towards AI - the question it tries to answer is "how are studios using AI", and not "should studios use AI". While player and IC developer sentiment is very negative right now towards AI (contrasted to generally positive sentiment from studio leaders), I expect sentiment will change over time as AI tools becoming increasingly ubiquitous. There is no definition of what the "correct' GAIT level for a studio should be, as that level could be higher or lower later as the conversation evolves.

## Some Interesting Parallels

### The Independent Craft Brewer Seal
I am a proud San Diegan, and like so many men of a certain age in this area, I got into homebrewing, about 20 years ago. This hobby connected me to the broader world of craft brewing, which has a surprising amount of connective DNA with game development - brewers are makers, full of creativity but constantly fighting for opportunities in an industry that doesn't always treat them right.

At the height of the craft beer craze (late 2010's), big beer companies were acquiring smaller craft breweries en masse. These smaller breweries weren't being integrated into the big beer co's brands or marketing; they were being kept separate and still presented as "craft", "local" or "indepdent", even if they were in reality owned by multinational conglomerates. This presented an "authenticity crisis" for beer buyers; one might stumble into a bar with 15 apparently "craft" beers taps of various brands and styles, but unless you were familiar with what's going on, you might think these were legitimate craft or local brands, not knowing that all of those beers are owned and produced by AbInbev, for example.

The independent beer response to this was the Independent Craft Brewer seal, created by the Brewer's Association. The BA created a set of criteria to define an "independent brewer" (based on ownership structure and production volume), and licenced this seal to those brewers, who could use it on their beer packaging and in their breweries. It was a signal to the relevant contituents (brewery owners, staff, and buyers) of the authenticity of the independent, local, and craft nature of what's being sold.

### Mortal Kombat and the ESRB
Another inspiration for GAIT is the ESRB, who oversees video game ratings in the US. I'm not saying I caused the ESRB to form, but I'm not not saying that.

In 1994, I, using all the clout I had as a 9 year old, wrote a letter to Nintendo of America, asking them politely to consider allowing Mortal Kombat II to feature blood when it was released for the SNES. Mortal Kombat was becoming famous then for it's over-the-top violence and gore; Nintendo had decided to mandate the game take out it's most violent content, and change the blood to "sweat" using a pallate swap.

In the response from Nintendo, the customer service representative alluded to working being done by Nintendo and it's industry peers, in response to inquiries from the US Congress, to establish a rating system for video games. This would become the ESRB. The backdrop to this was a series of hearing in Congress into violence in video games, with Mortal Kombat and the FMV game Night Trap being used as representatives as the level of explicit violence children who played video games were being exposed to.

The threat presented to game makers was legislative regulation; self-regulating via the ESRB headed off that threat. While there's no govenmental mandate that games be labeled with ESRB ratings in the US, they are required de facto in that major game platforms and resellers require ESRB ratings in order for games to be sold.
